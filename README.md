# MAD-ATV-DD

A idiot's conversion of 42mad autoconfig to 32bits MAD ATV Rom.
Not 16mad... not 42mad... something in between.

__32mad for 32bits__

Barely tested (if ever). Use at your own risk.

Why? To learn a bit more...and because no one was gonna do it anyway so why not me? ðŸ˜…

(Credits go for all the people that made the scripts I "borrowed" for this repo. Contents from this are 99% not mine, except for some precision editing and copy paste into the right (new) places when needed. I am just messing around a bit)

Rom can copy files from usb instead of downloading to speed up the process. Below files that can be added to usb with filename they must have:<BR>
  - rgc.apk
  - pogodroid_whatever.apk
  - pokemongo_whatever.apk
  - Magisk-v20.3.zip from <https://github.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD-ATV/raw/master/Magisk-v20.3.zip>
  - open_gapps-arm64-7.1-pico-20200715.zip from <https://madatv.b-cdn.net/open_gapps-arm64-7.1-pico-20200715.zip>
  - smali-s905w.zip from <https://github.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD-ATV/blob/master/smali/smali-s905w.zip>
  - NFS-INJECTOR-v7.8.FLASHPOINT.zip from <https://github.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD-ATV/raw/master/nfs/NFS-INJECTOR-v7.8.FLASHPOINT.zip>
<BR>  
  Note: NFS will only be installed when located on usb !! other files will me downloaded when not included.
