# MAD-ATV-DD

A idiot's conversion of 42mad autoconfig to 32bits MAD ATV Rom.
Not 16mad... not 42mad... something in between.

__32mad for 32bits__

Barely tested (if ever). Use at your own risk.

Why? To learn a bit more...and because no one was gonna do it anyway so why not me? ðŸ˜…

(Credits go for all the people that made the scripts I "borrowed" for this repo. Contents from this are 99% not mine, except for some precision editing and copy paste into the right (new) places when needed. I am just messing around a bit)
<BR>
<BR>
__BE PATIENT__ it takes 4 minutes for the device to show up in MADmin autoconfig !!
<BR>

  ## USB files
1. Make sure at least, like for 64bit autoconfig, that file ``mad_autoconf.txt`` is stored on usb.
2. Rom can copy files from usb instead of downloading to speed up the process see links below and do no change filenames:<BR>

  - <https://www.maddev.eu/apk/PogoDroid.apk>
  - whatever_pokemongo_whatever.apk
  - <https://github.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD-ATV/raw/master/Magisk-v20.3.zip>

<BR>  
  Note 1: NFS will only be installed when located on usb !! other files will me downloaded when not included.<BR>
  Note 2: For pogo make sure filename contains pokemongo <BR>
  Note 3: This ROM has been made for use with PTC Accounts. Google login does not work for Autoconfig and has not been tested in any way, so use PTC logins only<BR>
