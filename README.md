# MAD-ATV-DD

A idiot's conversion of 42mad autoconfig to 32bits MAD ATV Rom.
Not 16mad... not 42mad... something in between.

__32mad for 32bits__

Barely tested (if ever). Use at your own risk.

Why? To learn a bit more...and because no one was gonna do it anyway so why not me? ðŸ˜…

(Credits go for all the people that made the scripts I "borrowed" for this repo. Contents from this are 99% not mine, except for some precision editing and copy paste into the right (new) places when needed. I am just messing around a bit)
